## Usage

- GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state

- WHEN I review the appâ€™s store

- THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API

- WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store

- THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider

- WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state

- THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API

- WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store

- THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

- WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions

- THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
